# CHIBUIKEM-ENUJIUGHA-GOOGLE-PLAY-PYTHON-DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECT
# INTRODUCTION
This is a Python Project that shows analysis of data gotten from a Google Play Dataset on Kaggle.
# SECTION A: GOAL
The goal of this project is to obtainer a clearer understanding of how factors like application size amongst others influence the decision of user downloads in order to offer product managers and software developers a better picture of optimal metrics like application size, application price amongst others to increase the PROBABILITY OF DOWNLOADS at least during the time period when the dataset was obtained. This is key
# SECTION B: SKILLS DEMOSTRATED DURING THIS PROJECT
1.Data Sourcing
2.Data Transformation
3.Data Cleaning
4.Data Visualization
# SECTION C : PROBLEM STATEMENT 
The study aims to identify the main factors influencing the download rates and user engagement foe mobile applications on Google Play Store. This is done by analyzing a dataset of app metadata, and facts like app size, app download statistics amongst others.
 # SECTION D: METHODOLOGY
#  I.DATA SOURCING
After stating my problem statement ,the dataset was imported as a csv file into Jupyter Notebook(Python). The dataset was obtained from Kaggle consisting Google Play Downloads up to 2018
# II.DATA TRANSFORMATION/CLEANING
The Google Play Dataset was not in an entirely clean format so it had to be cleaned and transformed before it could be used to create visuals(graphs and charts).
